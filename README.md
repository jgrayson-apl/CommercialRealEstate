## ArcGIS Platform GeoEnrichment Service for Commercial Real Estate Site Selection


> This demo application uses the [GeoEnrichment Service](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/demographics/services/geoenrichment-service/) from [ArcGIS Platform](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/arcgis-platform/).

GeoEnrichment is the process of enhancing existing data with additional location-based information about the people and places in a specific area.
The additional information can drive better understanding, analysis, and decision making. For example, you can submit a point or polygon to the 
GeoEnrichment service and retrieve demographics and other facts associated with the location and surrounding area.

The GeoEnrichment service uses a sophisticated data apportionment methodology to aggregate demographic information for rings and other polygons.
For example, in the U.S. and Canada, data apportionment relies mostly on census block points. Block points are centroids derived from census block
boundaries, the most detailed level of census tabulation available. They contain attributes for the actual count of people and households living in
the associated block. For most other countries and regions settlement points are used for data apportionment. Settlement points are modeled by Esri
and provide an estimate of the likelihood of human settlement.
